THREADS allow multiple activities to proceed concurrently. Concurrent programming is harder than single-threaded programming, because more things can go wrong, and failures can be hard to reproduce. You can’t avoid concurrency. It is inherent in the platform and a requirement if you are to obtain good performance from multicore processors, which are now ubiquitous. This chapter contains advice to help you write clear, correct, well-documented concurrent programs.

线程允许多个活动并发进行。并发编程比单线程编程更困难，容易出错的地方更多，而且失败很难重现。你无法避开并发。它是平台中固有的，并且多核处理器现在也是无处不在，而你会有从多核处理器获得良好的性能的需求。本章包含一些建议，帮助你编写清晰、正确、文档良好的并发程序。
